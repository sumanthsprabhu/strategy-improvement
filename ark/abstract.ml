(* Counter-example based extraction of the affine hull of a formula.  This
   works by repeatedly posing new (linearly independent) equations; each
   equation is either implied by the formula (and gets added to the affine
   hull) or there is a counter-example point which shows that it is not.
   Counter-example points are collecting in a system of linear equations where
   the variables are the coefficients of candidate equations. *)
